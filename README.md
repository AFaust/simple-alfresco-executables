# About
This project is a hack-a-thon style experimental project to create simple executables for the Alfresco Content Services and Share applications. Initially this project aims to create Jetty-based executable "fat JARs" for these applications, which may form the basis of compiling these applications into native binaries at some point in the future using [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) / [SubstrateVM](https://github.com/oracle/graal/tree/master/substratevm).
